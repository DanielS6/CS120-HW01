    My favorite trip that I took in the last few years was when I did the
    "Tufts in Talloires" summer program during the summer of 2023. The program
    allows students to take Tufts classes, taught by Tufts professors, on a
    Tufts campus, that is located in the French Alps. Each student in the
    program takes two classes while in France - I took "International Law" and
    "Sociology of Travel and Tourism". The summer of 2023 was my
    <em>seventh</em> summer taking summer classes.

    My three favorite pet names are:
    <ul>
        <li>A cat named "Catrick Swayze"</li>
        <li>A turtle named "Shelldon Cooper"</li>
        <li>A seagull named "Meryl Streep"</li>
    </ul>

    My favorite restaurant is Hodgdon Food-on-the-Run, one of the Tufts dining
    establishments. For my last two years as an undergraduate student at Tufts
    I lived directly across the street from Hodgdon ("Hodge"), making it very
    convenient. Furthermore, they accepted the dining plan meal swipes in
    exchange for a specific cash equivalency, meaning that I didn't have to
    pay extra to get food from Hodge compared to eating in one of the dining
    halls. The website for Hodge can be found

    My favorite food is carrot cake. I love how my family usually has carrot
    cake, which comes without the frosting, but I also love carrot cake with
    the standard cream cheese frosting. I prefer to eat frosted carrot cake,

    and perfer it to be slightly chilled (cooler than room temperature but not
    straight out of the refrigerator). Its delicious, and because it contains
    carrots I can pretend that it is a little bit healthy, since carrots are
    a vegetable. On the left is an image of carrot cake, available in the
    public domain and hosted on
